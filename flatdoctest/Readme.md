This interface is fully customizable.
You can operate in the firmware to define witch information are presented in the interface, and in the HTML/JS part as well.

You can have an example of working web responsive interface at this url: [https://rotilio.cc](https://rotilio.cc)

If you want to learn about Particle.io API and Javascript with a simple but complete example with no third-party library head up to: [https://rotilio.cc/example](https://rotilio.cc/example).


## Technical datasheet v1.0

### Firmware

```
- Standard Arduino compatible
- FreeRTOS based
- OTA firmware update via cloud
- HTTPs Restful Cloud API
- Automatic application interface configuration
```

Automatic application interface configuration, a technology developed by us for Rotilio, lets you define an interface configuration for every device with different firmware using only one generic user interface.
You don't need to develop a different app for for every different project.

[Digg the code for more](https://github.com/techmakers/rotilio.cc/blob/master/firmware/RotilioSeed.ino)


### User interface
Ready to use, open source Web and Mobile user interface.
You can use our hosted [Web App](https://rotilio.cc) or donwload and customize the [code here](https://github.com/techmakers/rotilio.cc/tree/master/browser).

```
- HTML5+CSS+JS with AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, ChartJs
- PhoneGap ready
- User authentication
- Fully customizable
```

### Cloud connectivity
Basically Rotilio can expose variables like temperature, umidity,pressure, light and send events on changes of these and other variables.
Rotilio can receive instructions to switch on the relais, the buzzer, the RGB led and so on.

For standard operation you don't need to manage code, https calls and security but you may want customize Rotilio, so let's make some http restful examples.

(For full documentation about Particle.io Cloud API see [https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/))

For security sake, to post a cloud API call you need an Access Token like this ```a8e5239db48cdd43165abf879fcd7f43280cd874```. 

You can obtain the access token from the Rotilio user interface, look at the url after login.

##### How to read a variable from a device
the variable name is ```stats```, the device id is ```30001c000647343232363230```.

```
https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/30001c000647343232363230/stats?access_token=a8e5239db48cdd43165abf879fcd7f43280cd874
```

##### How to send a command to a device
the command is ```message```, the message argument is ```setrelais:on```. As you can guess, this is the command to switch on the Rotilio's relais.

```
https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/30001c000647343232363230/message?access_token=a8e5239db48cdd43165abf879fcd7f43280cd874&args=setrelais%3Aon
```

Lets' immagine how much can be simple to write down a web or mobile app to manage the garage door opening in les than an hour.

##### Listen to an event with Eventsource
The big thing is that Rotilio can send events to applications, servers and other cloud services.

```
https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/30001c000647343232363230/events/?access_token=a8e5239db48cdd43165abf879fcd7f43280cd874
```
For example, each time the Rotilio's relais switches to ON, you app can know this receving a message like below.

```
{"data":"relais:1","ttl":"60","published_at":"2016-01-07T22:15:30.482Z","coreid":"30001c000647343232363230"}
```

Typical power consumption: 
- 160 microA in deep sleep mode (Photon only)
- 450 mA full throttle with CPU+WiFI+Sensors+LED

Using deep sleep mode, Rotilio can be powered by batteries. The on board battery permits to store some variables you need to persists to restore the status of memory and CPU awaking from sleep.
The on board battery is not useful for power supply purpose, so you need to provide an external battery, connected to USB or +5v or +3.3v pins.

### About us

Rotilio is proudly crafted and developed in Genova by [Techmakers srl](http://techmakers.io), a startup for Internet connected industrial and consumer products.


## Rotilio from scratch

### Goal

Have a Rotilio working and on-line starting from a brand new Photon. (you don't need to do that if you bought Rotilio with the Photon, because we ship Photon with the firmware updated).

### Steps

1. Extract Photon from it's package and place it on Rotilio
2. Use activation procedure from [Particle.io](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/#step-1-power-on-your-device)
3. Upload Rotilio firmware to your Photon (see above for details)
4. Head on to [https://rotilio.cc](https://rotilio.cc) and log-in with same Particle.io credentials
5. Select your Rotilio and enjoy !!!



#### Upload Rotilio firmware to your Photon (step 3)

1. Clone or download the code [https://github.com/techmakers/rotilio.cc/tree/master/firmware](https://github.com/techmakers/rotilio.cc/tree/master/firmware) on your desktop (or wathever you prefer on your PC)
2. Head on to [https://build.particle.io/build](https://build.particle.io/build) and, if neccessay do login with your Particle.io credentials
3. After interface opens, click "Create new app" button in the "Code" section.
4. Name your App, eg: MyRotilio
5. Be sure to select the right Photon device in the "Devices" section
6. Click on "Flash" (the flash icon) to send the firmware to your Rotilio
